# Secret Stash

## Why Secret Stash

> Recipes are memories captured in food. They are family heirlooms passed down from generation to generation. Losing
> a recipe, is losing something very special and sentimental. Recipes on paper are a thing of the past. As Generations
> continue to grow technologically, recipes on paper will become obsolete. We need a way to store our family history with
> a lowered risk of loss. Secret Stash allows you to do just that. You can safely store all of your recipes in an app, with
> the ability to add, edit and delete them as you choose. You are also able to create folders to help organize your recipes as
> if you were using a binder, but more efficient. You can share any recipe with a family or friend, just by giving them the url.
